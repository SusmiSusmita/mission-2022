            <h1>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>Front-end developers are web developers who focus their efforts on the outward-facing parts of a
                product.Instead, these tech gurus focus on making the product aesthetically pleasing and ensuring it
                functions well for its users.I want to become a Front-end developer to to ensure that website visitors
                can easily interact with the page.I will do this through the combination of design, technology and
                programming to code a website's appearance, as well as taking care of debugging. </p>

            <h1>Global Community</h1>

            <p>Over the past few years lots of developer communities have come together with different goals and
                missions. The benefits offered by these communities are 'on another level' as I would say. They have
                helped people start from scratch and eventually land jobs in big tech companies like Google and
                Microsoft. They have also developed mentors and have helped improve their code writing and reviewing
                skills. </p>
